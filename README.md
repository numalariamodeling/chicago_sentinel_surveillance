# Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission with a novel outpatient sentinel surveillance system in Chicago, USA

We investigated whether sentinel surveillance of recently symptomatic individuals receiving an outpatient diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection could accurately assess the instantaneous reproductive number R(t) and provide early warning of changes in transmission.

**Figure 1.** Timing of indicators relative to infection.

* Reliable indicators of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection prevalence are necessary for timely intervention
* Case-based indicators (e.g. incident cases in the general population) are subject to bias due to differences in access to and demand for testing<sup>1,3</sup>
* Hospital-based indicators (e.g. emergency department visits, hospitalizations) lag infection by several weeks<sup>1,2,4,5</sup>
* Symptom onset occurs relatively soon after infection and symptomatic individuals are far more likely to receive a diagnostic test<sup>1,2,3</sup>
